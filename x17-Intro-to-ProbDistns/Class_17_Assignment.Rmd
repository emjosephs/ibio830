#### Due by midnight the day before the next class (10/30)

Save this Rmarkdown script as a file named “YourlastName_Assignment16.Rmd”. 
For each question, fill out the answer and, where requested, 
provide the relevant R code using "```" and the echo = TRUE argument.

When finished, Knit your script together into an html report, 
saved as “YourlastName_Assignment16.html” and upload the 
resulting file to the D2L site (in today’s class folder) to turn it in. 
It is due before our next class.



### Question 1

Re-answer question 2 from the previous homework using an analytical approach.

### Question 2

Data from Dr. Josephs' undergraduate class exams suggests that at any point, 
1% of students at MSU have an active COVID infection.

2a) What is the analytical probability that no one in our classroom 
has an active COVID infection? Assume that there are 35 people in the classroom.
\
\
\

2b) Write a function for simulating this problem for gatherings of arbitrary size.
The arguments of the function should be the number of people in the room 
and the probability that a randomly selected person in the county has COVID ,
and it should return the probability (from simulations), 
that no one in the room has COVID.
