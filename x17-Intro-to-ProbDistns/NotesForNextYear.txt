They did not learn what they needed to about distributions from this exercise. 

Specific issues -- using R to manipulate distributions other than the binomial.

One issue is maybe that in the group, only one person was working on the shiny app.

Future ideas:
Switch from shiny apps to google docs presentations with static figures 
Make an assignment that requires them to use the R functions for a distribution beyond the binomial.
