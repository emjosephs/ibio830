## Brief history {.build}

 - Derived by Laplace?
 
## Notation, parameters, bounds

If a random variable $X$ is gamma distributed, we write 

<div class="centered">
$\Large X \sim \Gamma(\alpha,\beta)$
</div>

Where
<div class="centered">
\beta = \frac{1}{\theta}
</div>
\

 - $\alpha$ is the shape parameter

 - $\beta$ is the rate parameter (equal to $\frac{1}{\theta}$ where $\theta$ is the scale parameter)

 - the gamma distribution is a **continuous** probability distribution
 
 - a draw from a gamma distribution is bounded between 0 and infinity
 
## Mean

The mean of a binomial is given by 

<div class="centered">
$\Large \mathbb{E}[X] = \alpha\theta = \frac{\alpha^{2}}{\beta}$
</div> 

\

### Intuition:

.

## Variance
The variance is given by

<div class="centered">
$\Large \mathbb{V}ar(X) = \alpha\theta^{2} = \frac{\alpha^{2}}{\beta^{2}}$
</div>

\

### Intuition:


## Things that are gamma distributed

 - the time it takes for a certain number of cell divisions to occur (or any other type of Poisson-distributed processes)
 
 - the distribution of fitness effects of new mutations

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(shiny)
  # input and output definitions
  # this is where you define the parameters of the distribution
  # (the binomial distribution has 2 parameters, `n' and `p',
  #		plus I have to define the number of replicates)
inputPanel(
 # Input: probability of success
 sliderInput("k", "shape:",
             min = 0, max = 20,
             value = 1, step=.25),
 ## Input: sample size
 sliderInput("theta", "scale:",
             min = 0, max = 20,
             value = 1, step = .25),
 ## Input: number of replicates
 sliderInput("n.reps", "number of replicates (trials):",
             min = 1, max = 5000,
             value = 100, step = 10)
)

# this function determines how the output 
# of the sliders is plotted
renderPlot({
  	# simulate data from the appropriately parameterized distribution
    x <- rgamma(n = input$n.reps,shape = input$k, scale = input$theta)
	# dynamically define a plot title that gives summaries of the data
	plot.title <- sprintf("Histogram of gamma draws")
  	# visualize simulated data as a histogram
    hist(x, col="mediumpurple3", border = "white",
         xlab = "",
         xlim=c(0,max(x)),
         main = plot.title,
         breaks=min(length(x),15))
})
