<!-- rmarkdown::render("Class_16_Assignment.Rmd") -->

#### Due by midnight the day before the next class (10/30)

Save this Rmarkdown script as a file named “YourlastName_Assignment16.Rmd”. 
For each question, fill out the answer and, where requested, 
provide the relevant R code using "```" and the echo = TRUE argument.

When finished, Knit your script together into an html report, 
saved as “YourlastName_Assignment16.html” and upload the 
resulting file to the D2L site (in today’s class folder) to turn it in. 
It is due before our next class.

**This homework assignment will test your abilities to:**

1. think critically and creatively about probability

2. use simulations to build intuition

3. use your R skillz: function building, data visualization, etc.

\

### Question 1

Define the following terms: 

1a) conditional probability

\
\
\

1b) random variable
 
 \
 \
 \
 
1c) probability distribution function
 
 \
 \
 \


### Question 2
\
<div class="centered">
$\Large {{n}\choose{k}}p^k (1-p)^{n-k}$
</div>

2a) Using your own words, break down the equation above and 
describe what each part means (or is doing).

\
\
\

2b) Using the function of this equation that you coded up in class (or from the slides), calculate the probability of 
seeing 71 successes out of 531 trials, where the probability of success is 0.12345.

\

### Question 3

Data from Dr. Josephs' undergraduate class exams suggests that at any point, 
1% of students at MSU have an active COVID infection.
What is the probability that no one in our classroom would has an active case of COVID?

3a) What is the analytical probability that no one in our classroom 
has an active COVID infection? Assume that there are 35 people in the classroom.

\
\
\

3b) What is the probability at least one person in the room **_does_** have an active 
COVID infection

\
\

3c) What is probability 2 people in the room are infected?

\
\

3d) Write a function for simulating this problem for gatherings of arbitrary size.
The arguments of the function should be the number of people in the room 
and the probability that a randomly selected person has an active COVID infection,
and it should return the probability (from simulations), 
that no one in the room has an active flu infection.

Note that for simulations, you want to use sample() to simulation whether people
do or do not have COVID, not the coin flip probability
function from earlier in homework.
