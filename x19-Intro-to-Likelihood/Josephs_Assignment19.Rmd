<!-- To render the assignment in Rmarkdown, enter the command below in the R console -->
<!-- rmarkdown::render("Class_19_Assignment.Rmd") -->

#### Due by the beginning of next class (11/11)

Save this Rmarkdown script as a file named “YourlastName_Assignment19.Rmd”. 
For each question, fill out the answer and, where requested, 
provide the relevant R code using "```" and the echo = TRUE argument.

When finished, Knit your script together into an html report, 
saved as “YourlastName_Assignment19.html” and upload the 
resulting file to the D2L site (in today’s class folder) to turn it in. 
It is due before our next class.

**This homework assignment will test your abilities to:**

1. think critically and creatively about probability distributions

2. extrapolate from in-class exercises to apply likelihood-based inference to arbitrary distributions

3. use your R skillz: function building, data visualization, etc.

\

### Question 1

Choose which probability distribution (from the bank below) would best describe 
the following types of data:

bank: {beta, exponential, gamma, lognormal,
	   normal, uniform, poisson, geometric, 
	   negative binomial, bernoulli, binomial}
	   
1. Lengths of ribbon left over after wrapping presents

2. A chess grandmaster's win percentage

3. Number of coding errors (bugs) in student homework assignments

4. Deviation from the mean height in a classroom of toddlers

5. Number of times you have to flip a USB drive over before you successfully put it into your computer

6. Number of games before your favorite sports team wins a game

7. Human arm length

8. Number of seagulls circling a fishing boat


### Question 2

What is the log product rule, and how/why is it used for likelihood-based inference?



### Question 3

Use maximum likelihood inference to estimate 
the parameter values I used to simulate data from a Poisson distribution, 
which are saved as a .Robj file in the Class 19 folder.
You should refer to the lecture .Rmd file for helpful reference 
code that you can cannibalize.

I've included pseudocode below to help you on your journey.

#		don't forget to specify full file paths and use quotes

# visualize data
#	hint: hist() is always a friend

# don't forget that the probability of a shared event 
#	should be calculated as the sum of the logs of the 
#	simple events that make up the shared event
#


# do a grid search over values of lambda
#	extra hint: you can use the histogram to inform the upper limit 
#				of your grid search!
