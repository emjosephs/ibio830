<!-- rmarkdown::render("Class_22_Assignment.Rmd") -->

#### Due by midnight before the beginning of next class (11/17)

Save this Rmarkdown script as a file named “YourlastName_Assignment22.Rmd”. 
For each question, fill out the answer and, where requested, 
provide the relevant R code using "```" and the echo = TRUE argument.

When finished, Knit your script together into an html report, 
saved as “YourlastName_Assignment22.html” and upload the 
resulting file to the D2L site (in today’s class folder) to turn it in. 
It is due before our next class.

**This homework assignment will test your abilities to:**

1. think critically and creatively about Bayesian inference

2. extrapolate from in-class exercises to apply Bayesian inference to arbitrary distributions

3. use your R skillz: function building, data visualization, etc.

\


### Question 1

1. Explain, in your own words, the goal and steps of an MCMC algorithm.


### Question 2

Below is a chunk of R code that implements an MCMC algorithm 
to estimate the rate parameter ($\lambda$) of a Poisson distribution. 
This code is uncommented - please write a comment for each line 
explaining what that line is doing.

```{r}

calcPostProb <- function(poisData,lambda){
	lnL <- sum(dpois(x=poisData,lambda=lambda,log=TRUE))
	lnPrior <- dnorm(x=lambda,mean=1,sd=1e6,log=TRUE)
	return(lnL + lnPrior)
}

mcmcPoisson <- function(poisData, nSteps){
	lambdaSamples <- rep(NA,nSteps)
	postProbSamples <- rep(NA,nSteps)
	lambda <- abs(rnorm(1))
	postProb <- calcPostProb(poisData,lambda)
	lambdaSamples[1] <- lambda
	postProbSamples[1] <- postProb
	for(i in 1:nSteps){
		lambdaPrime <- lambda + rnorm(n=1,mean=0,sd=0.3)
		if(lambdaPrime > 0){
			postProbPrime <- calcPostProb(poisData,lambdaPrime)
			postRatio <- exp(postProbPrime - postProb)
			if(postRatio > runif(n=1,min=0,max=1)){
				lambda <- lambdaPrime
				postProb <- postProbPrime
			}
		}
		lambdaSamples[i] <- lambda
		postProbSamples[i] <- postProb
	}
	return(
		list(
			"lambdaSamples" = lambdaSamples,
			"postProbSamples" = postProbSamples)
	)
}
```


### Question 3

Use the code above to do inference on the rate parameter 
I used to simulate the Poisson-distributed data saved in the 
.Robj file in the Class 22 homework folder on D2L.

Provide some visualizations of the results of your MCMC run.
Use your imagination here - if you were a data scientist, 
what plots would you want to show your client to convince 
them you had done a good job?
