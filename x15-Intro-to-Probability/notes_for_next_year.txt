From 2024
Rewrite first lecture to not use "probability" -- just simulate to figure out how the world works. This might make people less likely to use the rules of probability until we do them in the next lecture




From 2022
Didn't get to conditional probability this time. Think about how to streamline?

Also note that we are sampling kids with replacement. Maybe OK if the students figure that out on their own.


-------

start w/ pipeline showing data (response and predictor)

need a way to make quantitative statements about your data 
(e.g., is there an effect of X on Y, and if so, how much)

we do that by building a model and doing inference on the parameters

we do that by picking a probability distribution to describe our data 
and picking a deterministic function to describe the relationship between our 
predictor and response, then using likelihood-based inference to 
estimate the values of the parameters of the model

We do that using the principle of likelihood, 

which is based on the fundamentals of probability.

WORK THROUGH THIS PIPELINE AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH LECTURE, WORKING OUR WAY UP!

i think the best flow would be to do simple events -> complex events -> shared events where everything is independent
and then introduce non-independence and have them realize that expected is different from observed
and then use that to intro cond probs

drop lou shoes


from 2021: 
	change language on "die rolls" to make it clear that it's die 1 and die 2, not roll-of-2-dice 1 and 2
