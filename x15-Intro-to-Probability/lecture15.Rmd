## Today's lecture - Intro to Probability! {.build}

Learning goals:

Learn what probability is and the law of total probability.

Write basic simulations in R to build intuition about:

-simple mutually-exclusive events

-complex mutually-exclusive events

-shared non-exclusive events

-conditional probabilities

## Today's lecture - Intro to Probability! {.build}

Why do we care about probability?

- Many important biological processes are influenced by chance

- We don't want to tell science stories about coincidences.

- Understanding probability helps us understand statistics.

## How do you define probability? {.build}

\

A measure of the likelihood that an event will occur

A long-term frequency

How often we expect an event to happen ('degree of belief')

## How I use probability  {.build}
 Will I get to Park Place?

```{r, out.width="600px",echo=FALSE,fig.align="center"}
	knitr::include_graphics("figs/monopoly.png")
```

\
Which definition matches the probability of landing on Park Place?

## How I use probability  {.build}
When will I give birth?

```{r, out.width="600px",echo=FALSE,fig.align="center"}
	knitr::include_graphics("figs/duedate1.png")
```

\

Which definition matches the probability of giving birth on a specific day?

## How I use probability  {.build}

```

\

Which definition matches the probability of an election outcome?


## Today's class  {.build}

Building an intuition for how the rules of probability work using simulations.

## Simulating data

Simulations?

```{r, out.width="500px",echo=FALSE,fig.align="center"}
	knitr::include_graphics("figs/sims.jpg")
```

## Simulating data

One of the most powerful tools that we'll have in our statistics learning toolkit are simulations.

Simulations let you generate data that you know should look a certain way, so you can test your intuitions.

Simulations also let you do the same thing over and over and over.

## Simulating data {.build}

```{r}
thisClass = 1:35

thisClass
```

```{r}
sample(thisClass, size=1)

```

## Simulating data {.build}

```{r}
sample(thisClass, size=1)
```

```{r}
sample(thisClass, size=1)
```

## Questions we can answer with simulations

If we randomly pick a student, how likely are we to select student #19?

If we randomly pick 10 students, how likely are we to select student #19?

If we randomly pick 2 students, how likely are we to select students #19 and #20?

## Simulating students

If we randomly pick a student, how likely are we to select student #19?
```{r}

mySamples <- replicate(10000, sample(thisClass, size=1))
sum(mySamples==19)/10000

```

## Sample space {.build}

To think about probability, we start with the set of all potential outcomes (the "sample space")

For example, when you flip a coin the potential outcomes are heads and tails.

What was the sample space for our class example?

## Ball pit

```{r, out.width="600px",echo=FALSE,fig.align="center"}
	knitr::include_graphics("figs/fallingballs.gif")
```

The sample space for this example is that (<span style="color:#EDA158;">A</span>), The ball can fall through the orange bin, (<span style="color:#62CAA7;">B</span>) the ball can fall through the green bin, and (<span style="color:#98C5EB;">C</span>) the ball can fall through the blue bin

## Out in sample space {.build}

If we do something, one of the things in the sample space will happen.

Therefore, the probabilities of all the outcomes in the sample space will sum to one.

This is the **Law of Total Probability**

## Estimating probabilities {.build}

Looking at one short time from the previous example:

```{r, out.width="600px",echo=FALSE,fig.align="center"}
	knitr::include_graphics("figs/stillballs.jpeg")
```

What proportion of balls belong to each outcome?

<span style="color:#EDA158;">A</span> = 10/15

<span style="color:#62CAA7;">B</span> = 2/15

<span style="color:#98C5EB;">C</span> = 3/15

These proportions are an estimate of the true probability based on one sample.

## Probability distribution (sneak peak) {.build}

```{r}
mycols =  c("#EDA158","#62CAA7","#98C5EB")
barplot(c(10/15,2/15,3/15), col=mycols, xlab = "probability", 
        ylab = "sample space")

```


## Exclusive events {.build}

Outcomes that cannot occur at the same time are **mutually exclusive**.

For example, a coin could be heads or tails but not both.

But, a coin could be both heads up and a quarter. These would be **non-exclusive events**

## Simulating exclusive events {.build}

Let's write a simulation of the ball example with 500 balls. 

```{r}
myN <- 500
pA = 3/6
pB = 1/6
pC = 2/6

mySample = sample(x=c("A","B","C"), 
                  size = myN,
                  replace=TRUE,
                  prob = c(pA, pB, pC))

propA = sum(mySample=="A")/myN
propB = sum(mySample=="B")/myN
propC = sum(mySample=="C")/myN
```

## Visualizing the simulation {.build}

```{r}
mycols =  c("#EDA158","#62CAA7","#98C5EB")
barplot(c(propA, propB, propC), col=mycols, xlab = "probability", 
        ylab = "proportion", names.arg = c('A','B','C'))
```

## How many balls fell through A or B?

Work with your groups to calculate the probability of A or B happening.

Note that this is called a **complex event**, since it is the combination of multiple, mutually-exclusive outcomes.

## How many balls fell through A or B? {.build}

One way to solve the problem:

```{r}
propAorB = sum(mySample=="A") + sum(mySample=="B")
propAorB/myN

```

OR

```{r}
propAorB = 1 - propC
propAorB
```

## Simulating a sampling distribution

What if we want to simulate many samples to get a **sampling distribution** of how likely we are to get A or B?

## Simulating many samples

```{r}
nReps <- 100

sampleFunction <- function(myN){
                  mySample = sample(x=c("A","B","C"), 
                  size = myN,
                  replace=TRUE,
                  prob = c(pA, pB, pC))
                  
                  propA = sum(mySample=="A")/myN
                  propB = sum(mySample=="B")/myN
                  propC = sum(mySample=="C")/myN
                  
                  return(propA + propB)
                  }

mySamples <- replicate(nReps, sampleFunction(500))
```

## Visualizing the sample distribution

```{r}
hist(mySamples, main="", xlab = "proportion A or B")
```

## Non-exclusive events {.build}

What if events are not exclusive?

```{r, out.width="400px",echo=FALSE,fig.align="center"}
	knitr::include_graphics("figs/indep.gif")
```

How do we calculate the probability of falling through A and B?

## Shared non-exclusive events {.build}

We'll start by assuming that falling through A does not affect the probability of falling through B (we'll revisit this later).

If the $P(A) = 0.5$ and $P(B) = 0.5$, what is the probability of falling through both A and B?

## Simulate!

How can we edit this sample function to return the probability of falling through both A and B if $P(A) = 0.5$ and $P(B) = 0.5$?

```{r}
sampleFunction <- function(myN){
                  mySample = sample(x=c("A","B","C"), 
                  size = myN,
                  replace=TRUE,
                  prob = c(pA, pB, pC))
                  
                  propA = sum(mySample=="A")/myN
                  propB = sum(mySample=="B")/myN
                  propC = sum(mySample=="C")/myN
                  
                  return(propA + propB)
                  }
```

## Simulate!

```{r}
pA = pB = 0.5

sampleFunction2 <- function(myN){
                  mySampleA = sample(x=c(1,0), 
                  size = myN, replace=TRUE,
                  prob = c(pA, 1-pA))
                  
                  mySampleB = sample(x=c(1,0), 
                  size = myN, replace=TRUE,
                  prob = c(pB, 1-pB))
                  
                  myCombined = mySampleA + mySampleB
                  
                  probBoth = sum(myCombined==2)/myN
                  
                  return(probBoth)
                  }
```

## Look at our simulations
```{r}
mySamples <- replicate(100,sampleFunction2(100))

hist(mySamples, main="", xlab = "proportion A and B")
```

## What if A and B are not independent?

```{r, out.width="400px",echo=FALSE,fig.align="center"}
	knitr::include_graphics("figs/indep.gif")
```

## Conditional probabilities {.build}

Conditional probabilities describe the probability of outcome B given outcome A.

Conditional probabilities are really useful for thinking about the relationships between different events.

## Notation note {.build}

$P(A|B)$ is the probability of A conditional on B.

If $P(A|B)=0$, A and B are mutually exclusive.

**Warning**

In R, | means *or*

This is very unfortunate.

Stay safe!

## Simulating conditional probabilities

Work with your teams to modify our sampling function to simulate the following scenario: $P(A) = 1/3$, $P(B|A) = 1/2$, $p(B|not A) = 3/4$

How often do we find A and B?

Note that this is called a **shared event**, made up of multiple non-exclusive outcomes.

## Pseudocode for simulating conditional probabilities


```{r}
pA = 1/2
pB_given_A    = 4/5
pB_given_notA = 1/5

#write a function to do one trial (one ball)

#write a function to get a sample by running that trial 500 times

#write a function to generate 100 samples
```


## Simulating conditional probabilities

```{r}
#write a function to do one trial (one ball)
oneTrial <- function(){
  mySampleA = sample(x=c(1,0), 
                  size = 1, replace=TRUE,
                  prob = c(pA, 1-pA))
                  
                  if (mySampleA == 1){pB = pB_given_A}
                  else{pB = pB_given_notA}
                  
                  mySampleB = sample(x=c(1,0), 
                  size = 1, replace=TRUE,
                  prob = c(pB, 1-pB))
                  
                  myCombined = mySampleA + mySampleB
                  isBoth = sum(myCombined==2)
                  return(isBoth)
}
```

## Simulating conditional probabilities

```{r}
#write a function to get a sample by running that trial 500 times

sampleFunction3 <- function(myN){sum(replicate(myN, oneTrial()))/myN}

#write a function to generate 100 samples
mySamples <- replicate(100,sampleFunction3(100))


```

## Simulating conditional probabilities

```{r}
hist(mySamples, main="", xlab = "Prob of A and B")

```
