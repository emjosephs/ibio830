### Model information

Distribution: Normal distribution  
Deterministic function: Exponential Decay(N(t)=N0*exp(-lambda*t))  
Link function: g(mean)=mean, mean=N(t)  


### Story and variables

Northern Raccoon can resist and metabolize snake venom. If a raccoon is bit by a rattlesnake, the venom can be totally degraded within a certain period of time.  In a study, researchers injected a specific volume of snake venom into the bodies of raccoon, and observed the metabolism of toxin. By doing this experiment, people can better understand the resistance ability of raccoon to snake venom.

Predictor variable: metabolic time  
Response variable: Residual toxin


### Data Simulation

```{r}

## The parameters of the model
alpha<-100    # Initial venom concentration (N0)
beta<-0.1     # decay constant (lambda)
sd<-1.5       #sd of normal distribution

## Simulation
n<-1000       # number of points

predictor<-runif(min=0, max=100, n)   ##create predictor
response <- rnorm(n,mean=alpha*exp(-beta*predictor),sd)   ##create response
data <- data.frame(predictor,response)   ##create data frame

##Plot
expectation<-alpha*exp(-beta*predictor)

plot(response~predictor, main = "Residual Snake Toxin Amounts Based on Time Metabolised", xlab = "Time (hours)", ylab = "Percent of Injected Toxin Remaining")
lines(0:100 , 100 * exp(-.1 * 0:100),col="red",lwd=3)

##Output
write.csv(data,file="Relationship between residual drug and time.csv",row.names = FALSE)
