Stuff I've cut from other lectures that I may want to reuse.

## How I use R -- for work

- Data analysis, data exploration, R packages, figures, maps, calculator, reproducible code

## How I use R -- for fun {.build .smaller}

- choose an episode of Star Trek: Deep Space Nine to watch AT RANDOM!

```{r}
choose.ds9 <- function(season=NULL){
	ds9.ep.wiki <- paste0("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/",
						  "List_of_Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine_episodes")
	ep.names <- rvest::html_text(
					rvest::html_nodes(
						xml2::read_html(ds9.ep.wiki),
						".summary"))
	ep.names <- gsub("\"","",ep.names)
	if(is.null(season)){
		season <- sample(1:7,1)
	}
	n.eps <- c(20,26,26,26,26,26,26)
	episode <- sample(1:n.eps[season],1)
	ep.name <- ep.names[sum(n.eps[1:season]) - n.eps[season] + episode]
	return(paste0("Season ",season,", Episode ",episode,":  ",ep.name))
}
choose.ds9()
```
