Make a guide/decision tree/map/dichotomous key/Cosmo quiz to choose the distribution that best matches a dataset.

Your map should help you choose between the following distributions: beta, exponential, gamma, lognormal, normal, uniform, poisson, geometric, negative binomial, binomial

To learn about the distributions, check out wikipedia as well as the built in functions in R.

For example, we can use the rbinom function to understand the binomial distribution:

```{r}
mysample = rbinom(100,1000,0.5)
head(mysample)

hist(mysample)

mysample2 = rbinom(100,1000,0.1)
hist(mysample2)
```


In pt 2 on Thursday, you will use your key to determine the distribution that best matches the following scenarios and associated datasets. This assignment will be due midnight, Monday November 12.
