Make a guide/decision tree/map/dichotomous key/Cosmo quiz to choose the distribution that best matches a dataset.

Here are the distributions your map should help you choose between the following distributions: beta, exponential, gamma, lognormal, normal, uniform, poisson, geometric, negative binomial

To learn about the distributions, check out wikipedia as well as the built in functions in R.

For example, we can use the rbinom function to understand the binomial distribution:

```{r}
mysample = rbinom(100,1000,0.5)
head(mysample)

hist(mysample)

mysample2 = rbinom(100,1000,0.1)
hist(mysample2)
```


Please submit your guide/decision tree/map/dichotomous key/cosmo quiz/something else to D2L. Then use your key to determine the distribution that best matches the following scenarios:
